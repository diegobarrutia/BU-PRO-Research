equation.py: Using the Brillouin Zone to convert sigma to an integral, we are able to graph |X(t)| vs Time (ps). This is the first graph. Additionally , the long term of the X(t) is derived form the Indepent Boson Model (IBM) and plotted. We use different chirality values to understand its effects on the decoherence behavior.

Chirality: Using the magnitude of unit vector and unit cell length, we are able to calculate for the chirality. The chirality applied in equation.py were derived from this file.

Norm Comparison (Coding and Analytical).py: To double check the work, we derive the norm analytically and compared it with the code. As we can see in the model produced, both graph fit confirming the reliability of the code.
